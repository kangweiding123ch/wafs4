=========================

MITx: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming.  -- This repo is full of my solutions to the problems. Still new to CompSci / Python, feel free to suggest anything better if I'm doing something wrong.

Trying to learn Git as soon as I can so I'm not behind later on. If this isn't the correct use of git, please let me know.
